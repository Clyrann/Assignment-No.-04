Answer:
The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As we tackled these topics, we have learned that the HTML is the markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. And is relatively easy to learn and understand, as it mainly involves using various tags to define the elements on the page. CSS, on the other hand, is used to style and format web pages. It can be more challenging to learn as it involves understanding the properties and values that control how elements on a page are displayed, but it is essential for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. And lastly the JavaScript, is a programming language that adds interactivity to web pages. It can be more challenging to learn than HTML and CSS because it involves writing code to manipulate elements on the page and respond to user input, but it is also incredibly powerful and can be used to create complex web applications.
Overall, each of these technologies serves a specific purpose and requires a unique set of skills to master. Some people may find one more natural or challenging than the others, depending on their background and interests. But for me the most natural for me would be the HTML. Because it acts as the backbone of a website it was easily familiarize to my mind compared to the CSS and JavaScript that was lately introduced after learning the HTML.
